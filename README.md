Recommendations
Considering the rate of attrition from each department: 
Human Resources=26%, Life Sciences=15%, Marketing=22%, Medical=14%, Other=13%. This summarizes the attrition rate to be 16%. My recommendations goes thus:
The company should focus more on the staff welfare.
The company should improve on the working environment, that is, to make the environment friendly.
The company can increase the salaries of the employees in order to reduce the rate of attrition and be able to retain dedicated and committed employees
Conclusion
The company should incorporate rewarding dedicated and hardworking employees which serves as a great motivation to employee retention and also to ensure friendly working environment.
